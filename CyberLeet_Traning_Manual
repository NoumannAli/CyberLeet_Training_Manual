Project Outcome: Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles

Artifact: CyberLeet Training manual. This manual contains an introduction of core tenets off cybersecurity, developing cybersecurity policies and threat mitigation scenarios. The original purpose of this document was to learn the process involved with hardening a companyâ€™s cybersecurity practices by providing a training manual that outline cybersecurity best practices for employee training purposes.

Justification: The CyberLeets Company manual outlines the results of a security assessment, accompanied by prevention strategies and best practices. I understood the security responsibilities of professionals as a consultant to a big organization and was willing to provide professional opinions on the safety protocols that could be enforced. Before any proposals were made, the legal and ethical principals  were discussed first. The knowledge, skills, and abilities that were required to demonstrate competency while creating this artifact include understanding the core tenets of cybersecurity: Confidentiality, Integrity, and availability.

Reflection/ Articulation of Response: This project provided me good exposure to the cybersecurity concepts. The main objective of this project was to create security awareness manual for the cyberleet company which included best practices to mitigate potential security risks and theats. The manual also included cyber ethics principals about the security of the company network. The main principle in the manual was CIA. Which is Confidentiality, integrity and Availability. The challenges I faced while creating this artifact was defining the requirements for employees to ensure they are not the cause of a vulnerability. Ultimately it came down to user training, however, I was able to find some engineered solutions when conducting my research. I picked this artifact because its best suits the requirements for this courses outcomes. If I were to recreate this project again I may update the techniques and process to match the technology and knowledge of this year 2019. This artifact set me up for success in the real world because it opened my eyes to the human factor that a security consultant has to consider in order to ensure the best threat mitigation for employees.
